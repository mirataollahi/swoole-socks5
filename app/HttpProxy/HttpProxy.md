Key Implications for Your Proxy:


- Must handle multiple concurrent TCP connections
- Each CONNECT tunnel is isolated from others
- Need proper connection timeout management (both client and server sides)
- Should support connection reuse for performance
- Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of handling these concurrent connections? For example, how to properly manage the connection lifecycle or handle connection limits?
